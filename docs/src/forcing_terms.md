# ForcingTerms Module

The ForcingTerms module specifies external magnetic field perturbations for the perturbed
equilibrium calculation. It supports reading from ASCII or HDF5 files, as well as computing
perturbations directly from coil Biot-Savart calculations.

## Normalization conventions

Two normalization tags are supported, specified inside the file (not in `gpec.toml`):

| Tag | Quantity | Units | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|-------|
| `"normal_field_T"` | Fourier modes of B·n̂ | Tesla | **Default** — most intuitive for users |
| `"sfl_flux_Wb"` | Fourier modes of R×(B_R ∂Z/∂θ − B_Z ∂R/∂θ) | T·m² | 2π-angle SFL flux (user input) |

### Angle convention

Julia's ForcingTerms use the **unit-norm angle convention** (θ_norm ∈ [0, 1], ζ_norm ∈ [0, 1])
internally, matching Fortran GPEC and the Equilibrium/ForceFreeStates modules.

The coil Biot-Savart pipeline produces mode amplitudes directly equal to Fortran's `Phi_x`:

```
Julia output ≡ Fortran Phi_x
```

The formula is `Phi_x(θ_norm, ζ_norm) = 2π × R × (B_R ∂Z/∂θ_norm − B_Z ∂R/∂θ_norm)`, where
the `2π` comes from the toroidal Jacobian ∂r/∂ζ_norm = 2π·R·ê_φ.

Users who provide forcing files may use the more intuitive **2π-angle Fourier amplitudes**
(e.g. the amplitude of cos(mθ − nζ) where θ ∈ [0, 2π]). These are tagged `"sfl_flux_Wb"`
and multiplied by (2π)² internally to reach unit-norm convention.

### Automatic conversion

Files tagged `normal_field_T` are automatically converted to unit-norm Phi_x convention
during loading using the plasma boundary geometry. The conversion accounts for the
R-variation of the Jacobian and is a mode-mixing operation.

Files tagged `sfl_flux_Wb` (2π-angle SFL flux) are scaled by (2π)² to reach unit-norm.

The coil Biot-Savart code (`forcing_data_format = "coil"`) always produces unit-norm
amplitudes directly — no conversion is applied.

## ASCII file format

```
# normalization: normal_field_T
# Format: n  m  real(amplitude)  imag(amplitude)
1  6  1.0e-4  0.0
1  7  5.0e-5  2.0e-5
```

- The `# normalization: <tag>` line is optional; default is `normal_field_T`.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored by the data parser.
- Columns: toroidal mode n, poloidal mode m, real part of amplitude, imaginary part (optional, default 0).
- Amplitudes are in Tesla (for `normal_field_T`) or T·m² (for `sfl_flux_Wb`).

## HDF5 file format

Required datasets:
- `n`: integer array of toroidal mode numbers
- `m`: integer array of poloidal mode numbers
- `amplitude_real`: float array of real parts
- `amplitude_imag`: float array of imaginary parts (optional)

Optional root attribute:
- `normalization`: string, either `"normal_field_T"` (default) or `"sfl_flux_Wb"`

Example (Julia):
```julia
using HDF5
h5open("forcing.h5", "w") do f
    f["n"] = [1, 1, 1]
    f["m"] = [5, 6, 7]
    f["amplitude_real"] = [1e-4, 2e-4, 1e-4]
    f["amplitude_imag"] = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    HDF5.attrs(f)["normalization"] = "normal_field_T"
end
```

## Coil Biot-Savart format

Set `forcing_data_format = "coil"` in `[ForcingTerms]` TOML to compute the field
directly from coil geometry. Output is always in `sfl_flux_Wb` convention.

The coil pipeline:
1. `sample_boundary_grid`: evaluate plasma boundary geometry at (mtheta × nzeta) grid
2. `compute_biot_savart_boundary!`: compute B at all grid points via Biot-Savart law
3. `project_normal_flux!`: compute Phi_x = 2π×R×(B_R ∂Z/∂θ_norm − B_Z ∂R/∂θ_norm)
4. `fourier_decompose_bn`: Fourier decompose to get bmn in unit-norm (= Phi_x) convention

Steps 2–4 are linear in the coils, so a `CoilForcingGrid` (step 1 plus the observation-point
layout, built once per equilibrium and `n`) can be reused to evaluate coil sets one at a time
with `coil_forcing_modes`; the per-set spectra sum to the assembly's. Use this when many coil
variants must be compared against one plasma — moved or re-wound coils, or one coil at a time —
without re-sampling the boundary:

```julia
forcing_grid = CoilForcingGrid(equil, cfg, n; psi=ffs.psilim)
spectra = [coil_forcing_modes(cs, forcing_grid, n, m_low, m_high) for cs in coil_sets]
```

The toroidal angle for each observation point at SFL grid coordinate (θ_i, ζ_j) is:
```
φ_phys(i, j) = -helicity × (2π × ζ_j + ν(ψ, θ_i))
```
where `helicity = sign(Bt) × sign(Ip)` and `ν(ψ, θ)` is the SFL toroidal coordinate correction
stored in `equil.rzphi_nu`. This matches Fortran's `phi = -helicity*(twopi*czeta + crzphi_f(3))`.
For DIII-D (Bt < 0, Ip > 0 → helicity = -1), ν ranges from about -3.4 to +3.4 radians at the
boundary — omitting it completely scrambles the Fourier mode decomposition.

### Coil geometry sources

Each `[[ForcingTerms.coil_set]]` block supplies one coil set from one of several sources,
selected by `source`. Shifts and tilts (`shiftx/y/z`, `tiltx/y/z`, `n_tilt`, ...) apply to
every source, so analytic coils can be perturbed exactly like file-based ones.

```toml
# Legacy ASCII .dat file (unchanged; resolves to {dat_dir}/{machine}_{name}.dat)
[[ForcingTerms.coil_set]]
name = "il"
currents = [1e4, 1e4, 1e4, 1e4, 1e4, 1e4]

# Modern HDF5 file; `name` selects one set from a multi-set file (omit if it holds one)
[[ForcingTerms.coil_set]]
source = "file"
h5_file = "/path/to/my_coils.h5"
name = "il"
currents = [1e4, 1e4, 1e4, 1e4, 1e4, 1e4]

# Analytic PF hoop — a horizontal circle; tilt breaks axisymmetry to give n ≠ 0 forcing
[[ForcingTerms.coil_set]]
source = "pf_hoop"
radius = 1.8
height = 0.9
currents = [5e3]
tiltx = [2.0]

# Analytic window-pane (picture-frame) array — corner mode: two opposite [R, Z] corners
[[ForcingTerms.coil_set]]
source = "window_pane"
ncoil_gen = 8
rz_corners = [[2.2, -0.6], [2.2, 0.6]]
gap_fraction = 0.15
currents = [1e3, -1e3, 1e3, -1e3, 1e3, -1e3, 1e3, -1e3]

# Analytic window-pane — standoff mode: placed by physical distance off the plasma surface.
# The frame center sits `standoff` m along the outward surface normal at cylindrical
# `poloidal_angle` (degrees); legs span `poloidal_length` m, tilted by `poloidal_tilt`
# (degrees, 0 = tangential). Requires an equilibrium (the main forcing pipeline supplies it).
[[ForcingTerms.coil_set]]
source = "window_pane"
ncoil_gen = 2
standoff = 0.25
poloidal_angle = 0.0
poloidal_length = 1.2
poloidal_tilt = 0.0
gap_fraction = 0.15
currents = [1e4, -1e4]

# Analytic helical array on a circular cross-section torus (pitch = m/n).
# theta_lo/theta_hi (poloidal extent, degrees) default to a full 0–360 turn.
[[ForcingTerms.coil_set]]
source = "helical"
R0 = 1.7
a = 0.6
m_hel = 4
n_hel = 1
n_coils = 4
currents = [1e3, 1e3, 1e3, 1e3]
```

### HDF5 coil geometry format

A coil HDF5 file stores one **subgroup per coil set** under a parent group (default `coils`),
so a single file can hold many sets and the reader ignores any unrelated content elsewhere:

```text
<group>/<set_name>/x         Float64 ncoil×s×nsec   Cartesian metres
<group>/<set_name>/y         Float64 ncoil×s×nsec
<group>/<set_name>/z         Float64 ncoil×s×nsec
<group>/<set_name>/currents  Float64 ncoil          optional
<group>/<set_name>  attr nw  Float64                winding multiplier, default 1.0
```

Use `convert_coil_dat_to_h5` / `convert_coil_h5_to_dat` to migrate legacy files, and
`read_coil_h5` / `write_coil_h5` for direct I/O.

### Rerun snapshot

When a coil run writes `gpec.h5`, the coil geometry actually used (after shifts/tilts and with
currents) is captured under `Input/RawInputs/Coils/`. The run can then be replayed with
`main_from_h5` even if the original `.dat`/`.h5` files are gone:

- `--coil-source forcing-modes` (default) recomputes the field from the stored TOML coil config
  (needs the original geometry files to be present).
- `--coil-source coils` recomputes the field from the geometry stored in `gpec.h5`, so no
  original files are required — and the equilibrium may be overridden on replay.

## Comparison with Fortran GPEC

| Quantity | Julia convention | Fortran GPEC convention |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Angle range | θ_norm ∈ [0, 1], ζ_norm ∈ [0, 1] | θ_norm ∈ [0, 1], ζ_norm ∈ [0, 1] |
| Coil forcing output | unit-norm = 2π×R×(B_R ∂Z/∂θ_norm − B_Z ∂R/∂θ_norm) | `Phi_x` [Wb] |
| Ratio | Julia output ≡ Fortran Phi_x (directly comparable) | — |
