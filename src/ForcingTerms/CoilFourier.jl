    CoilFourier

Converts coil Biot-Savart fields on the plasma boundary into Fourier mode amplitudes
suitable for the perturbed equilibrium pipeline.

## Pipeline
- `sample_boundary_grid` — evaluate (R, Z) and unit-norm metric on the plasma boundary
- `CoilForcingGrid` — the boundary grid with its observation points laid out, shared by every coil evaluation
- `compute_biot_savart_boundary!` (BiotSavart.jl) — compute B at all grid points
- `project_normal_flux!` — compute flux Φ_x = 2π×R×(B_R ∂Z/∂θ − B_Z ∂R/∂θ)
- `fourier_decompose_bn` — 2D Fourier decompose to get bmn amplitudes
- `coil_forcing_modes` — Biot-Savart → projection → decomposition for any coil set(s) on a `CoilForcingGrid`
- `compute_coil_forcing_modes!` — top-level entry point combining all steps for a whole assembly

    BoundaryGrid

Pre-computed plasma boundary grid for evaluating coil fields.

## Fields

  - `mtheta`, `nzeta`: grid dimensions
  - `R`, `Z`: cylindrical coordinates `[mtheta]` (same for all ζ, axisymmetric)
  - `phi_grid`: base toroidal angle grid `[nzeta]` in radians = `-helicity × 2π × j/nzeta`
  - `phi_offset`: per-θ toroidal angle correction `[mtheta]` from SFL coordinates:
    `ν(ψ, θ)` scaled by `-helicity`, so the physical toroidal angle at `(i, j)` is
    `phi_grid[j] + phi_offset[i]`. Matches Fortran's `phi = -helicity*(2π*ζ + dphi(ψ,θ))`.
    Zero for axisymmetric equilibria on-axis; non-zero off-axis due to SFL coordinate
    transform (Hamada/SFL θ ≠ geometric θ introduces a toroidal offset).
  - `dR_dtheta`, `dZ_dtheta`: poloidal derivatives w.r.t. unit-norm angle θ_norm ∈ [0,1]
    `dR_dtheta[i] = dR/dθ_norm = 2π × dR/dθ_phys`

    sample_boundary_grid(equil, mtheta, nzeta; psi=equil.rzphi_xs[end]) -> BoundaryGrid

Evaluate plasma geometry at a uniform (mtheta × nzeta) grid on the flux surface `psi`.

Uses `equil.rzphi_rsquared` and `equil.rzphi_offset` splines at the given `psi`.

Defaults to the **outermost computed surface** `equil.rzphi_xs[end]` (i.e. `psihigh`), NOT
ψ_N = 1, matching Fortran GPEC.

**Fortran reference** (PrincetonUniversity/GPEC v1.5.7): the coil field is evaluated at
`psilim`, never at ψ_N = 1 — `CALL field_bs_psi(psilim, coilmn(:,j), ...)` (`gpec/gpec.f:431`).
`field_bs_psi` is the direct analog of this function, using the same two splines and the same
square root: `rfac = SQRT(crzphi_f(1))` (`coil/field.F:170`, where `crzphi_f(1)` is
`rzphi_rsquared` and `crzphi_f(2)` is `rzphi_offset`); `coil/field.F:133` calls that mesh the
"control surface mesh". `psilim = psihigh` (`dcon/sing.f:170`) and is only ever moved *inward*
by `sas_flag`/`qhigh`/`psiedge` truncation. Since `psihigh` is the last knot of the radial
grid these splines are built on (`equil/inverse.f:142`), Fortran evaluates exactly ON the last
knot and never extrapolates. The docs state it directly: the external field is specified "on
the surface of the GPEC plasma boundary defined by the psihigh variable in equil.in"
(`docs/index.rst:60`). The previous ψ_N = 1 default was a port divergence.

Both Fortran-comparison benchmarks already pass the correct surface explicitly
(`benchmark_against_fortran_run.jl:548` and `benchmark_coil_ForcingTerms_against_fortran.jl:236`,
both using Fortran's own `psilim` attribute), so the ψ_N = 1 default was never exercised on any
Fortran-validated path — only by callers that omitted the keyword.

Why it mattered numerically: the geometry splines are defined only out to `psihigh`, so ψ_N = 1
extrapolates a cubic past its last knot with no guarantee of remaining physical. On the
DIII-D-like example (psihigh = 0.995) `rzphi_rsquared` is +0.29 at ψ_N = 0.995 but −22.6 at
ψ_N = 1, negative over 15 of 96 θ points, so the `sqrt` below throws a DomainError. The
extrapolated distance is a fixed 1 − psihigh while the final spline interval shrinks with edge
packing, so the error grows with resolution — which is why this surfaced only once the pass-1
auto grid was refined.

NOTE ON THE DEFAULT: the physically correct control surface is `psilim`, the *integration*
limit, not `psihigh`, the *equilibrium spline* limit. They are equal unless
`dmlim`/`qhigh`/`psiedge` truncation fires, in which case `psilim < psihigh`. PPPL shipped a fix
for exactly this confusion (`docs/releases.rst:281`: "Fixes inappropriate uses of psihigh, which
may not be the end of integration psilim if sas_flag, qhigh, or peak_flag are used").

**Both production paths pass `psi = ffs_intr.psilim` explicitly** (PerturbedEquilibrium.jl, coil
and forcing-file branches), as do both Fortran-comparison benchmarks. This default of `psihigh`
therefore applies only to direct callers holding a bare `PlasmaEquilibrium` with no
ForceFreeStates solve — for which it is the outermost surface that exists, and always a strict
improvement on extrapolating to ψ_N = 1. Pass `psi` explicitly whenever `psilim` is known.

The coupling surface therefore moves inward by (1 − psihigh): 0.05 % of flux at the default
psihigh = 0.9995, 0.5 % on the example, which lowers psihigh to 0.995 to capture q=6.
Poloidal derivatives dR/dθ_norm and dZ/dθ_norm (unit-norm θ_norm ∈ [0,1]) are computed
via periodic cubic splines on the resulting R(θ_norm), Z(θ_norm) data.

The toroidal grid direction follows the Fortran GPEC convention:
`phi_j = -helicity × 2π × j/nzeta`   where `helicity = sign(Bt) × sign(Ip)`.
This is derived from `equil.params.bt_sign` and `equil.params.crnt`.
For DIII-D (Bt < 0, Ip > 0 → helicity = -1): phi increases with j (standard direction).
For positive-helicity machines (Bt > 0, Ip > 0 → helicity = +1): phi decreases with j.

Convert `ForcingMode` amplitudes from `from_tag` normalization to the internal

If `from_tag == "sfl_flux_Wb"`, the user has provided amplitudes in the 2π-angle
SFL-flux convention. These are scaled by (2π)² to reach unit-norm.

If `from_tag == "normal_field_T"`, the amplitudes represent Fourier modes of B·n̂
in Tesla (2π-angle convention). Conversion to unit-norm Phi_x:

  - Inverse-Fourier reconstruct B·n̂(θ, ζ) from the input modes
  - Multiply pointwise by 2π × R(θ) × |dr/dθ_norm(θ)|
  - Re-Fourier transform to get unit-norm mode amplitudes

The 2π factor comes from the toroidal Jacobian ∂r/∂ζ_norm = 2π·R·ê_φ.
This conversion is a mode-mixing operation because R and |dr/dθ| vary poloidally.
