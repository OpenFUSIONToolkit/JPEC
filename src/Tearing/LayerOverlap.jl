# Resistive-layer overlap scan: how far out in ψ the equilibrium domain needs
# to extend before adjacent rational surfaces' resistive layers run into each
# other. Once two neighbouring layers overlap, neither surface has a
# well-separated inner region, so the matched-asymptotic treatment stops being
# meaningful there and extending `psihigh` past that point buys nothing.
# Criterion: Fitzpatrick, Nucl. Fusion 2025 (doi 10.1088/1741-4326/ae4fdd) Sect. 5.9 —
# retain surfaces with psi < 1 - eps_c, where overlap is judged with the
# diffusive-resistive layer width of its Eq. (100), the regime strong shear forces
# near the separatrix.
#
# Lives in `Tearing` rather than `InnerLayer/SLAYER` for the same reason
# `build_ggj_inputs` does: it needs `ForceFreeStates._find_rational_surfaces`,
# and `InnerLayer` loads before `ForceFreeStates`.
#
# Surfaces beyond the equilibrium's own ψ grid are located on the separatrix edge
# law q ≈ -A·ln(1-ψ), via the shared `Equilibrium.edge_q_law` helper that also gates
# the grid-refinement edge density model -- one statement of the model, one fit, one
# limited-plasma guard. The log form is the only one that survives the extrapolation:
# a polynomial in ψ (on q or on ι = 1/q) saturates instead of diverging, undershooting
# the outermost surfaces enough to report no overlap where there is one.
#
# The extrapolated surfaces inform the *choice* of domain only; the final
# equilibrium is always re-formed and solved on the accepted domain.

    LayerOverlapScan

Per-surface resistive layer widths and the `psihigh` they imply, from
[`resistive_layer_overlap`](@ref).

All widths are in **normalized flux**, converted from the metre-valued
`LayerWidths` scales by `Δψ = w / |da/dψ|` so they can be compared against
surface *separations* in ψ. Comparing the metre values directly against ψ is a
dimensional error.

# Fields

  - `m`, `n` -- resonant mode numbers per surface, ordered by increasing ψ
  - `psi` -- surface location in normalized flux
  - `rs` -- minor radius at the surface in meters
  - `delta_s_m` -- `|δ_s|`, the Riccati resistive layer width, in meters
  - `width_delta_s` -- the same width in normalized flux, `|δ_s|/|da/dψ|`
  - `width_visco` -- the visco-resistive comparison scale as a Δψ width
  - `width_dr` -- the diffusive-resistive width of Fitzpatrick (2025) Eq. (100) as a Δψ
    width. This is the criterion the recommendation uses: the paper's Sect. 5.6 shows that
    strong shear near the separatrix forces every layer there into the DR regime
  - `extrapolated` -- true when the surface was located outside the
    equilibrium's ψ grid via the edge q-law
  - `psihigh_delta_s`, `psihigh_visco`, `psihigh_dr` -- domain implied by each width
    channel, `nothing` when that channel never overlaps within the scanned range
  - `psihigh` -- the recommendation, equal to `psihigh_dr`: the DR width is the criterion
    (Sect. 5.6 puts every near-separatrix layer in that regime). The other two channels are
    reported for comparison and do not set the domain
  - `first_overlap` -- index of the first surface that overlaps its inner
    neighbour, `nothing` when none do
  - `notes` -- surfaces that were located but could not be scored, and why

    resistive_layer_overlap(equil, profiles::KineticProfiles; n_tor, kwargs...)
        -> LayerOverlapScan

Locate the q = m/`n_tor` rational surfaces, compute each one's resistive layer
width, and report the outermost `psihigh` at which adjacent layers are still
separated.

Surfaces inside the equilibrium grid come from
`ForceFreeStates._find_rational_surfaces` (Brent root-finding segmented between
q-extrema, so reverse shear is handled). Surfaces beyond the grid come from the
separatrix edge law `q ≈ -A·ln(1-ψ)` fitted over the outer knots when
`extrapolate=true`, which is what lets the scan recommend a domain *larger* than
the one it was handed. See the file header for why a cubic extrapolation is not
usable here.

Layer widths come from [`slayer_layer_thickness`](@ref) via
[`build_slayer_inputs`](@ref), so the scan uses the same plasma inputs and the
same resistivity closure as the SLAYER analysis itself.

# Arguments

  - `equil` -- a formed `PlasmaEquilibrium`
  - `profiles` -- `KineticProfiles` spanning the scanned ψ range

# Keyword arguments

  - `n_tor` -- toroidal mode number; surfaces are q = m/`n_tor`

  - `m_max` -- runaway backstop on the poloidal mode number (default `2000`), **not** the
    physics limit: the outward search should terminate at `psi_cap` (indistinguishable from
    the separatrix), and if `m_max` is what stops it instead, the scan says so in `notes`
    because "no overlap found" would then rest on a non-physical cutoff
  - `max_layer_solves` -- bound on how many surfaces get a Riccati layer solve (default `64`,
    innermost kept). The first overlap decides the answer, so surfaces far beyond it only cost
    time; when the bound bites, `notes` records that a "no overlap" verdict is inconclusive
  - `psihigh_safe` -- treat this as the outer edge of trusted equilibrium data
    (default `equil.profiles.xs[end]`)
  - `psi_cap` -- never place a surface beyond this ψ on the **direct** path (default
    `1 - 1e-9`, purely numerical: it stops the outward search from crowding indefinitely onto
    ψ = 1 where surfaces become indistinguishable). Inverse equilibria ignore it: they have a
    prescribed boundary and the search runs to ψ = 1 on the real q. Geometry needs no clamp of
    its own -- `radial_label` derivatives are analytic and valid under extrapolation
  - `extrapolate` -- search past `psihigh_safe` on the edge q-law (default `true`)
  - `theta` -- poloidal angle for the minor-radius chord (default `0.0`)
  - `rs_method` -- radial label the widths and their ψ-conversion Jacobian are taken in
    (default `:midplane`; see `radial_label`). The caller wiring this scan into the domain
    truncation passes `:flux`, the label Fitzpatrick Eq. (100) is anchored to
  - `mu_i`, `zeff`, `chi_perp`, `chi_tor`, `resistivity_model`, `lnLambda_form`
    -- passed through to `build_slayer_inputs`

The overlap criterion is that surface `k` overlaps its inner neighbour when
`ψ_k − w_k/2 < ψ_{k-1} + w_{k-1}/2`. When that happens **both** surfaces are
contaminated, so the recommendation cuts at the inner edge of surface `k-1`,
leaving `k-2` as the outermost trustworthy surface.
