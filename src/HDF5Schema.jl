# Metadata tables for the datasets written by write_outputs_to_HDF5 (the main gpec.h5
# writer), applied post-write by Utilities.HDF5Annotations.annotate!. Sub-writers
# (Galerkin, PerturbedEquilibrium, KineticForces, Tearing) keep their tables next to
# their own writers. Paths absent from a given run are skipped automatically.
#
# Conventions (docs/development/hdf5-conventions.md): units are SI strings, "1" for
# dimensionless; ψ always means the normalized poloidal flux ψ_N ∈ [0, 1]; stability
# energies are power-normalized (per unit surface-averaged |ξ|², not joules); `dims`
# lists axis names in Julia (column-major) order, axis 1 first.

# Equilibrium scalars are written by iterating EquilibriumParameters' fields. The struct keeps
# its legacy field spellings; these tables give the HDF5 datasets their literature names and
# drop fields that duplicate another dataset or echo a control flag (inputs live only under Input/).
