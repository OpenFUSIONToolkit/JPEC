Radial grid refinement utilities for the two-pass auto ψ grid.

Pass 1 forms the equilibrium on a coarse grid; `refined_psi_grid` then derives a knot
density from the measured nodal data (1D profiles, 2D geometry channels, and optional
kinetic profiles) and equidistributes it, pinning mandatory knots (e.g. rational surfaces)
via `merge_mandatory_nodes`. Pass 2 re-forms the equilibrium on the refined grid through
the `override_psi_nodes` keyword of `setup_equilibrium`.

There is ONE sizing rule everywhere — the cubic *derivative* interpolation error model
err(f′) ≈ h³|f''''|/24 ≤ τ·f_scale — applied to three sources of curvature |f''''|:

 1. *Measured* (mid-radius and edge): 5-point divided differences of the pass-1 nodal
    values. Nodal values come from independent field-line integrations, so the estimate
    is immune to inter-knot spline ringing. This source dominates wherever pass-1 data
    supports it — including the edge, where the pass-1 layout is already log-packed
    (on the DIII-D example the measured density supplies ~3× what the edge model demands).
 2. *Separatrix model* (edge floor, ψ ≥ 0.9): q ≈ −A·ln(1−ψ) fed through the same rule
    gives geometric packing with uniform relative q′ error, independent of A. Normally
    inactive; insurance against a pass-1 that under-sampled the divergence.
 3. *Axis model* (core, ψ ≤ 0.03): the equilibrium is a power law in ψ (smooth in
    ρ = √ψ) near the axis, and the same rule on that form gives geometric-in-log(ψ)
    packing. Here the model *replaces* measurement rather than flooring it — nodal data
    from the smallest flux surfaces is dominated by integration and axis-extrapolation
    error, which refinement amplifies rather than resolves.

The stability physics consumes spline derivatives (q′ at rational surfaces, p′ and V′ in
the Euler-Lagrange and ballooning coefficients), whose error at a given spacing is far
larger than the value error — hence the derivative model. Every region's knot count
scales as psi_accuracy^(-1/3), so tightening the tolerance refines edge, pedestal, and
mid proportionally.

Measured curvature is taken with respect to ρ = √ψ_N, in which the equilibrium is regular
at the magnetic axis (R−R₀ ~ √ψ_N makes the geometry channels behave as ψ_N^(k/2) there,
so their ψ-derivatives diverge under refinement but their ρ-derivatives do not); the
resulting ρ-spacing maps back to the ψ density through dψ/dρ = 2√ψ_N, giving natural √ψ
core packing outside the modeled core region as well.

density floor and by the resistive-layer overlap scan's out-of-grid surface search.

Returns `nothing` when the diverging model does **not** describe this equilibrium's edge, so a
plasma with finite edge q is never extrapolated as if q blew up:

  - fewer than `min_knots` knots in the band;
  - `A ≥ 0`, i.e. q not rising toward ψ = 1;
  - `r2_log < min_r2` — the log law does not actually fit;
  - `r2_log ≤ r2_linear` — a plain linear-in-ψ fit explains the edge q at least as well, which is
    what a **limited** plasma looks like. This comparison carries no scale and is what separates
    the shipped limited decks (Solovev 0.760 vs 0.9996 linear; LAR 0.904 vs 0.998) from the

Drop interior nodes so no two kept nodes are closer than `hmin`, preserving both endpoints.
Guards against noise-level packing from any generator — the auto-grid near-surface bracket, or a
fixed `ldp`/`pow1` grid whose edge spacing collapses (`~(π/2·mpsi)⁻²` for `ldp`) at high mpsi,
below which cubic high derivatives are integration noise, not curvature. A no-op when the grid is
already coarser than `hmin` everywhere (e.g. a converged uniform reference).

    bracket_mandatory_nodes(grid, centers, min_half_widths, min_spacing; collapse_atol=1e-7) -> Vector{Float64}

Center each rational `centers[i]` inside a single clean spline interval by replacing the knots
straddling it with a symmetric pair at `centers[i] ± w`. The half-width `w` is the larger of
`min_half_widths[i]` (the Δ′-stencil floor `BRACKET_COEF·dpsi`) and **half the local grid
spacing**, so the bracket blends into the surrounding grid rather than punching a narrow interval
into it: the region stays locally uniform with the center at its midpoint. That local uniformity
is what keeps the cubic 3rd derivative the Δ′ extraction samples both *consistent across* the
surface (no knot-on-surface jump) and *stable across* grid refinement — a narrow bracket amid
wide neighbors would be consistent but noisy. Non-bracket knots within `w` of the center, or
within `min_spacing` of either new bracket knot, are dropped; endpoints always win; bracket knots
outside the open domain are dropped, and knots closer than `collapse_atol` are collapsed to keep
the grid strictly increasing.

Build the refined pass-2 ψ grid from a formed pass-1 equilibrium: measured-curvature knot
density (`_knot_density`), equidistribution, a global minimum-spacing floor
(`enforce_min_spacing`), and rational-surface bracketing (`bracket_mandatory_nodes`). `tau` is
the target interpolation accuracy (`psi_accuracy`); `kin` optionally supplies kinetic profiles
whose pedestal gradients attract knots; `mandatory` lists rational-surface ψ values to bracket;
`singfac_min` and `n_min` (smallest |n| in the run) set each surface's matching half-stencil
`dpsi = singfac_min/(n_min·|q′|)`, and the bracket half-width is `bracket_coef·dpsi` (floored at
`min_spacing`). Rational surfaces are bracketed, not pinned: a knot on the surface would make the
Δ′ extraction's cubic 3rd derivative jump mid-stencil (see `BRACKET_COEF`).

`psihigh` builds the grid for a domain *smaller* than the one `equil` was formed on: the measured
density is truncated there and the last node lands exactly on it. This lets a pass-1 equilibrium
supply the density for a re-form on a reduced domain without an extra solve. Passing a `psihigh`
beyond the pass-1 grid is an error — the density out there is unmeasured, so an enlarged domain
must be formed first and refined against that.
