    CalculatedKineticMatrices

Bridge from KineticForces' bounce-averaged matrix kernels into the kinetic-MHD
stability path in ForceFreeStates. Used by `build_kinetic_matrix_splines` when
`ctrl.kinetic_source == "calculated"` (via the `calculated_source` callback
injected from `GeneralizedPerturbedEquilibrium.main`).

                                        kf_ctrl=KineticForcesControl(),
                                        kinetic_profiles)
        → (kw_flat, kt_flat)

Drive the KineticForces matrix kernel over the ψ grid stored in `metric.xs` and
return `(kw_flat, kt_flat)` arrays of shape `(mpsi, np^2, 6)` matching the
contract that `ForceFreeStates._compute_fkg_matrices` consumes.

The arrays carry the six bounce-averaged kinetic energy / torque matrices
(Logan 2015 Eqs 7.30–7.35) for every ψ on the equilibrium grid, packed as
block-diagonal matrices over toroidal mode number n ∈ [nlow, nhigh] and
flattened to `(np = mpert·npert)²`.

This routine reads equilibrium-derived profiles (q, dV/dψ, ⟨r⟩, ⟨R⟩) directly
from named splines on `equil.profiles` and `equil.geometry`, and kinetic
profiles (n, T, ω_E, ν) from the `kinetic_profiles` argument, avoiding the
former shadow-copy pattern in KineticForcesInternal. The perturbation-mode
interpolants (`kf_intr.dbob_m`, `kf_intr.divx_m`) remain unwired and are
tracked as follow-up work blocked on PR #196 — see the plan's "Out of scope"
section.

# Arguments

  - `ffs_ctrl`: ForceFreeStatesControl (carries `kinetic_factor`, `kinetic_source`)
  - `equil`: PlasmaEquilibrium with 2D interpolants and named profile/geometry splines
  - `ffs_intr`: ForceFreeStatesInternal (mode indexing)
  - `metric`: MetricData (provides ψ grid via `metric.xs`)
  - `mats`: MatrixSplines (used only for `numpert_total` cross-check)

# Keyword arguments

  - `kf_ctrl`: KineticForcesControl, defaults to `KineticForcesControl()`. Used to
    carry NTV-specific knobs (nl, zi, mi, wdfac, divxfac, electron) that the
    KineticForces kernel needs but ForceFreeStatesControl does not expose.
  - `kinetic_profiles::Equilibrium.KineticProfileSplines`: Required. Named kinetic-
    profile splines loaded via `Equilibrium.load_kinetic_profiles`.

# Returns

  - `kw_flat::Array{ComplexF64,3}`: Energy matrices, shape `(mpsi, np^2, 6)`
  - `kt_flat::Array{ComplexF64,3}`: Torque matrices, shape `(mpsi, np^2, 6)`
