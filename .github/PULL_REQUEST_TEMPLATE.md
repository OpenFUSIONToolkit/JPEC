## Regression report

<!--
Required on every PR (docs/development/regression-harness.md). Paste the report below and
put the commit you ran it at in the harness stamp above; CI fails if src/ changed afterwards.

Commit your work and compare branch refs: each git ref runs in its own worktree, so the run is
unaffected by anything you edit while it is going. `local` runs in the live checkout instead,
one subprocess per case, and an edit mid-run silently mixes code versions within one report.

    regress --cases diiid_n1 --refs develop,<your-branch>

## Notes for reviewers

<!-- Anything that is not obvious from the diff. Delete if there is nothing. -->

---

Set an **assignee** and at least one **human reviewer**; if you are not ready to name them, open this as a **draft**. Lead developers to ask are listed in `docs/development/contributors.md`. Labels are applied automatically from the title.
