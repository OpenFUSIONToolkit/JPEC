Golden values: committed, reviewable reference numbers for a case.

The `--refs` comparison answers "did this change?"; it cannot answer "is this right?", because
both sides come from the same working copy of the code and nothing is recorded in git. Golden
values close that gap: one TOML file per case, tracked alongside the source, holding the value
of every quantity plus the tolerance it must be reproduced within and the evidence behind that
tolerance.

The tolerance policy is the load-bearing part. A tolerance is a claim about how much a quantity
may legitimately move, so it is *derived* — from the residual drift at a convergence plateau and
from the spread measured across platforms — never chosen to make a check pass. `update_golden`
refuses to write a tolerance below the recorded platform spread, and a failing check is fixed by
explaining the physics or fixing the regression, not by widening the bound.
"""

"""
How strictly a quantity must reproduce, and why.

  - `topological` — integer counts and mode numbers; exact equality
  - `equilibrium_scalar` — spline/quadrature outputs with no adaptive branching; very tight
  - `physics_converged` — the quantities golden values exist for (δW, Δ′, torque, growth
    rates); tolerance comes from the measured convergence plateau and platform spread
  - `diagnostic` — ODE step counts, runtimes; recorded and reported, never gating, because they
    describe the numerics rather than the physics
  - `unconverged` — measured and found to have no plateau; tracked differentially, never pinned,
    so that a known-unconverged quantity is visibly excluded instead of quietly given a wide bound
